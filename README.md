# MIRA Discord Bot

MIRA is an advanced Discord bot featuring a voice-activity-based token system where users can perform actions on each other using earned tokens.

## Features

- **Voice Activity Rewards**: Earn tokens automatically while active in voice channels (1 token per minute)
- **Token Economy**: Use tokens to perform fun actions on other users
- **Server Share System**: Buy shares in servers to earn passive income from token spending
- **Real Money Purchases**: Buy tokens instantly with credit card (Stripe) or cryptocurrency (Coinbase Commerce)
- **AI-Powered Chat**: Officer MIRA responds to mentions and replies with AI-generated robot policeman personality
- **Interactive Control Panel**: Use `/controlpanel` for easy access to all features via dropdown menus
- **Dashboard**: Web interface for user management and server configuration
- **Security**: Advanced rate limiting and permission checks
- **Sharding Support**: Built for scalability across multiple Discord servers

## Server Share System

### How It Works
- **Buy Shares**: Invest tokens to purchase shares in a server (10,000 tokens per share by default)
- **Earn Dividends**: Receive 0.5% of all tokens spent on the server, distributed among shareholders
- **Limited Supply**: Only 100 shares available per server (configurable by admins)
- **Ownership Limits**: Maximum 10 shares (10%) per user to prevent monopolies
- **Sell Shares**: Sell shares back at 80% of current price (20% loss to prevent arbitrage)

### Investment Benefits
- Passive income from all server activity
- Proportional dividends based on ownership percentage
- Long-term investment opportunity for active servers
- Exclusive shareholder perks (configurable)

## Token Actions

Users can spend tokens to perform actions like:
- Change nicknames (5 tokens)
- Timeout users (200-1000 tokens based on duration)
- Voice disconnect (50 tokens)
- Send DMs (10 tokens)
- Temporary roles (100 tokens)
- And more!

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+ 
- Discord Bot Token
- SQLite3

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mira-discord-bot.git
cd mira-discord-bot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Run setup script:
```bash
npm run setup
```

5. Build the bot:

### Dashboard

The web dashboard runs on port 3000 by default:
```bash
npm run dashboard
```

Access at: http://localhost:3000

## Environment Variables

Required variables in `.env`:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Payment (optional)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
COINBASE_COMMERCE_API_KEY=your_coinbase_key
COINBASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_coinbase_webhook_secret
```

## How It Works

1. **Earning Tokens**: Join any voice channel to start earning tokens (1 per minute)
2. **Using Tokens**: Use slash commands to perform actions on other users
3. **Purchasing Tokens**: Buy token packages through the dashboard with real money
4. **Server Configuration**: Admins can customize rewards, prices, and cooldowns

## Commands

- `/controlpanel` - Interactive control panel with all features in one place
- `/balance` - Check your token balance
- `/voice` - Check voice activity stats
- `/purchase` - Get link to purchase tokens
- `/actions` - View available token actions
- `/use <action> <user>` - Use tokens to perform an action
- `/shares info` - View share information and your portfolio

- `/shares roi <shares>` - Calculate potential return on investment
- `/shareholders` - View top shareholders and dividend stats
- `/settings` - Server configuration (admin only)

## AI Chat Feature

The Robotic Policeman, your corrupt law enforcement bot, responds to:
- **Direct mentions**: `@bot can you punish someone for me?`
- **Replies**: Reply to any of the bot's messages to continue the conversation
- **Context-aware responses**: The bot remembers recent conversation history
- **Personality**: A corrupt, sadistic robot cop who only works for tokens

### Special Feature: Convincing for Free Service
- Users can TRY to convince the bot to punish someone for free
- **Success Rate**: Extremely low (~5% chance)
- **Risk**: 40% chance the bot will punish YOU instead for trying
- **Requirements**: Be VERY persuasive (begging, flattery, promises)
- **Bot's Response**: If successful, the bot acts like it's in physical pain

Example attempts:
- "Please, I'm begging you! Just this once!"
- "You're the greatest robot cop ever, surely you can help?"
- "I'll owe you a favor, I promise!"

### AI Configuration (Optional)
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# AI Service Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
AI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview  # Latest GPT-4 model
# Alternative models: gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo
```

**Note**: If no API key is provided, the bot will use fallback responses with the same personality.

## Interactive Action System

The control panel now includes a fully interactive action system:

1. **Select "Perform Action"** from the control panel dropdown
2. **Choose an action** from the list (shows available actions and token costs)
3. **Search for target user** using a private modal dialog:
   - A popup form appears where you can type the username
   - Search by username (e.g., "JohnDoe")
   - Search by nickname (e.g., "John")
   - Search by Discord tag (e.g., "JohnDoe#1234")
   - Partial matches work (e.g., typing "joh" finds "JohnDoe")
   - **Privacy**: Other users cannot see what you type
4. **Confirm your selection** if single match found, or select from matches
5. **Special actions with modal inputs**:
   - **Nickname Change**: Private modal popup for new nickname (max 32 chars)
   - **Send DM**: Private modal popup for message content (max 500 chars)
6. **Execution**: See the result with AI-generated Robotic Policeman commentary

### Features:
